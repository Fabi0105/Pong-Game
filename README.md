# Pong-Game
My first python project, a very simple Pong game
If it seems too messy, or some things are outright wrong, i would appreciate some help
One of the things ive been trying to add is a restart function but i cant seem to get it right, ive tried looking up how other people do them and ive tried asking some ai for help but nothing works
If someone has any tips i would love to hear them, thank you
